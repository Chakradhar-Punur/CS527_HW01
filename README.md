## Question 1 – Country Diversity Across Sports

**Goal:**  
Identify the top 10 countries that won medals in the largest number of different sports, along with total medals and medal distribution across sports.

**Key Result:**  
Countries like USA, France, and China appear at the top, indicating broad participation and success across many disciplines rather than dominance in a few sports.

**Interpretation:**  
Higher sport diversity often correlates with stronger overall Olympic programs.

## Question 2 – Gender Consistency in Medal Performance

**Goal:**  
Find countries that rank in the top 10 for both male and female medal counts and analyze gender dominance.

**Key Result:**  
Only a subset of countries consistently perform well across both genders, indicating balanced investment in men’s and women’s sports.

**Interpretation:**  
Countries with balanced gender performance tend to have more stable Olympic success.

## Question 3 – Age Diversity vs Medal Success

**Goal:**  
Measure age diversity of Olympic teams using standard deviation of athlete ages and compare with medal success.

**Key Result:**  
Some countries show high age diversity but low medals per athlete, while others achieve high success with more age-concentrated teams.

**Interpretation:**  
Age diversity alone does not guarantee success; optimal performance likely depends on sport-specific age peaks.

## Question 4 – Athlete Height and Medal Success

**Goal:**  
Identify ideal height ranges associated with medal success for each sport and gender.

**Key Result:**  
Distinct height ranges dominate medal outcomes in many sports (e.g., taller athletes in Athletics, shorter ranges in Gymnastics).

**Interpretation:**  
Physical attributes such as height are strongly sport-dependent and correlate with medal success.

## Question 5 – Medal Concentration Among Athletes

**Goal:**  
Analyze how medals are distributed among athletes within each country to identify concentration effects.

**Key Result:**  
Only a few countries show extreme medal concentration where the top 3 athletes win all individual medals.

**Interpretation:**  
Most successful countries distribute medals across many athletes, while extreme concentration is rare and typically seen in smaller delegations.
